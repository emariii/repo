## Hand Gesture Recognition for Controlling Computer's Mouse Cursor
This is a Python project for controlling a computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures. The program recognizes hand gestures through a webcam using the Mediapipe library and controls the mouse cursor via the PyAutoGUI library.

The project is divided into two files, `app.py` and `controller.py`. The `app.py` file contains the main program logic while `controller.py` is responsible for handling the mouse cursor movement and click events.

## Requirements
To run the program, the following libraries are required:

OpenCV
Mediapipe
PyAutoGUI

You can install these libraries using pip:
