## Hand Gesture Recognition for Controlling Computer's Mouse Cursor
This is a Python project for controlling a computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures. The program recognizes hand gestures through a webcam using the Mediapipe library and controls the mouse cursor via the PyAutoGUI library.

The project is divided into two files, `app.py` and `controller.py`. The `app.py` file contains the main program logic while `controller.py` is responsible for handling the mouse cursor movement and click events.

There is an extra file, `requirements.txt` which you can use to install the libraries required for this project.

## Requirements
#### To run the program, the following libraries are required:<br>
  - OpenCV<br>
  - Mediapipe<br>
  - PyAutoGUI<br>
 
#### You can install these libraries using pip:<br>
  -  `pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui`<br>
#### Or you can use the following command using pip to avoid any library version issue:<br>
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
